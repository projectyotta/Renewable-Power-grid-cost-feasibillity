> The eiadata part contains columns for each type of data we wanted ( units mentioned in the header) . 
> Some columns had very less data - those are the other 2 eai files in this folder . I do not know how you want to handle missing values ... there is only data for 4 years in these 3 files . This is why I have kept them as is in the folder. 
> the weather data . Three major things are kt , t2m,ws10m - solar index , temp at 2 m , wind speed at 10 m . 
There are seperate columns for max , min , mean of these values ( since I had to aggregate from the original values ). 
> The physics part of it which ties together the relationship between solar energy produced and electricity generated is also mentioned . 
> The total_renewable_policy_count	 , Wind_policy_count	, Solar_photovoltaic_policy_count
has a numeric count of the number of policies that a state has for each of these categories for renewable energy . The data has been gathered from http://www.dsireusa.org . Reputable source , cuz funded by the government . 

> The explanation for the relationships : 

wind and energy produced 

The general formula is p = 0.5 * density * area * v ^ 3 * Cp 
0.5 , density , the pi in area = pi * r^2 have been multiplied to get the equation . 

for wind , Power = 1.93 * V^3 * R^2 * Cp , in watts
Cp is max power coefficient , varies from 0.25 to 0.45 . Max of 0.59
r is radius of swept area in meters
V is wind speed  in m/s ( we have this )


Solar and energy produced 

power = solar constant * isolation clearness index * r^ 2 * conversion efficiency , in watts 

We consider the solar constant , which is equal to 1367 watts / m ^ 2 . This does not change a lot , and can therefore be assumed constant . 
r is length of solar panel 
conversion efficiency varies from 0.14 to 0.24 . Theoretical max of 0.46 . 
Isolation clearness index ( we have this )





What has been done 

1. Figured out reverse geocoding for the google maps API to identify each lat long value by state . Assigned state to each row in weather data . 
2. I used Pandas to clean up the weather data - handled a lot of missing value kind of data. There might still be a few here and there , but I'd say around 95% + is filled in . 
3. I aggregated the weather data by month and year. To avoid inaccurate data , I have the (mean,max,min) for (solar index , temperature , wind speed ) . This will give a much wider spread. 
4. WRT the EIA data , I have cleaned all of the datasets we considered. Three of the datasets were especially small when compared to the others , so I did not integrate them with the rest. They have been left as seperate files by themself.( The reason they are small is because on the EIA website , they have data for only 4 years , while the others have it for 15 years ). 
5. I have merged all of the EIA datasets into a single file, cleaned it up and handled a lot of the missing values. There might still be a few here and there , but I'd say around 95% + is filled in . 
6. I learnt that substituting the NaN values in these 3 files to merge all of them together leads to bad accuracy in even linear regression. 
7. I figured out the  relationship between electricity production and wind/solar generation. I will put it up in the whatsapp group and the drive as well. I have connected the equations generated to the values we have with us (Some we do not , but can be gathered and appended to the dataset pretty easily). We can now calculate difference between theoretical production and actual production.
8. There is still some processing to do with the physics bit. I can do it , but I want you guys to work on it. The same is the case with the EIA missing values thing.  
9. Will upload the ipnyb files if someone needs it. 
10. The data is in the drive .
